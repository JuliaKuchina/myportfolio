          I love to design and build UI for applications. There is some magic in
          how small changes in colours, element position, image or animation can
          cause a huge impact on user experience. I write simple code that is
          easy to use and maintain. I have a lifelong passion for geometry and
          maps, enjoy challenges, end-of-edge technologies and wonderful people.

        <p>I have a masters degree in mathematics and computer science.</p>
